MoviesGenrePrediction
==============================

Problem1: 
Netflux is an online platform that enables users to watch movies on smart TVs, PCs, Macs, mobiles, tablets, and so on. They have people write overviews for each movie to show in the preview section. They need to make sure that the written overviews represent the genre(s) of the movie.
We need to predict the genre(s) of the movie given the written overview.


Solution:
- Data: Pulled using TMDB API
- Algorithm:
  - SVC with TF-IDF
  - Naive Bayes with Count Vectorizer
  - Neural Network with Word2Vec
